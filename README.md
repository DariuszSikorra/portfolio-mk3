## About

That's the latest version of my portfolio.
Finally, I decided to do a react portfolio with a responsive interface.

##Libriaries and dependencies:

-[React.js](https://reactjs.org) with create-react-app as the main js library,<br/>
-[React-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for a smooth transition between components,<br/>
-[React-spring](https://www.react-spring.io), as a library for website animation,<br/>
-[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) as a graphic postprocessor for easy page styling.
