        <p>
          I graduated from Gdansk University of Technology in the field of
          physics. I started my programming adventure during studies by using
          C++, creating a simulations of heat flow in solid bodies. I am looking
          for opportunities to learn in a professional development environment
          and gain first experience as a front-end developer. My goal is to
          become a front-end developer using the latest technologies.
